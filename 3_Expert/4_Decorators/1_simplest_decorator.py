Topic: Decorators
Difficulty: 4/5
Requires: functions, closures

Task:
Write two functions:
- my_sum, expects an unknown number of arguments that should be added together
- decorator_function, provides a logging functionality and should
print the number of arguments, the name of the function passed to the decorator,
and the execution time of the passed function.

To see the advantage of a decorator, write another function 'my_mult', which
has a similar behavior as 'my_sum', but multiplies the arguments. Decorate
the function and execute it.
